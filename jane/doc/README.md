# Documentation of Jane Street OCaml extensions

This directory contains documentation of our extensions.

The `extensions/` subdirectory will be mirrored directly to the OxCaml website
on compiler release.  Adding new files in the existing directories should just
work, but if you change the structure it is also necessary to change the
website's code, which is kept in an internal Jane Street repository.
